/**
 * WMC - Weighted Methods Per Class Computed as the sum of VG of all methods implemented by the class - VG(m) is McCabe's cyclomatic complexity number.
 * It is given by the size of the basis set of paths through the control flow graph of function m. For a single entry, single-exit control flow graph consisting of e edges and n nodes, VG(m) =e-m+n 
 * [T. McCabe]
 * VG(m) can be computed as the number of decisions node +1
